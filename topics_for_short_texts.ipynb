    "# Practical Topic Finding for Short-Sentence Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many analysis applications involve finding topics in corpora of short sentences, such as tweets, short messages, logs and comments. On one hand, the direct insights provided in these topics will serve as the basis of many further analysis, e.g., sentiment scoring or document classificaition. On the other hand, those short texts have some unique characterics that deserve more attentions when applying the traditional topic-finding algorithms to them. Some challenges are\n",
    "- Short texts usually have higher language variability, where the same meaning can be phrased in various ways [[1]](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S12-1005). For example, \"dollars\", \"\\$\", \"$$\", \"fee\", \"charges\" may all have similar meanings; but this is harder to capture in shorter sentences due to the limited information of surrounding contexts of each word.\n",
    "- Unlike longer articles such as wiki pages, short comments or tweets may each have a single topic. At first glance it may look like a simplification. But practically it poses challenges when the algorithms to be applied assume a mixture of topics in each document. Forcing a sparse representation usually comes with a price, either computational or performance-related.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it even more complicated, topic-finding is a multiple-step process, involving preprocessing of texts, vectorization, topic-mining and finally topic representations in keywords. Each step has multiple choices in practice and the different combinations may generate very different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article explores the pros and cons of differnet algorithmic decisions in topic-finding, by considering the natures of short texts discussed above. Instead of providing a bird's-eye view of theoritical comparisons, I want to highlight how a practical decision should be made based on the structure of your data and the structure of your topics. A good theoritical review can be found in [[2]](http://anthology.aclweb.org/D/D12/D12-1087.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following I use \"toy-like\" artificial data to make those \"blackbox\" models transparent. All the models compared below are implemented in Python [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package. "

    "## 2. Topic Finding Models\n",
    "\n",
    "I look into three topic-finding models, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation ([LDA](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf)), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization ([NMF](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611972740.45)), and Truncated Singular Value Decomposition ([SVD](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html)). There are many extensions of these traditional models and different implementations. I pick those from [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the three traditional topic models, another related approach in finding text structures is document clustering. One of its implementation [KMeans Clustering](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) has also been included in this comparison although it is usually not considered as a topic model approach. You can find interesting discussions on the differences of the models [online](https://www.quora.com/search?q=nmf+vs+lda). The code comments below also provide addtional information on why an implementation decision is made in that way."

However, in addition to structuring the texts this way, there is another potential dimension that can group \"berger\" vs \"sandwich\" as \"foods topic\" and \"hate\" v.s. \"love\" as \"feelings topic\". Is there any setup that can find topics in this new perspective?\n",

    "Let's first take a step back and consider what makes a \"good\" topic modelling. Although the standard should depend on the nature of the analysis, there are usually some common understanding. For many cases, the keywords in each topic should be \n",
    "- frequent enough to appear in more than a few documents/sentences. Topics covering only a few examples may not be interesting, unless outlier detection is the purpose. \n",
    "- representative enough to distinguish one topic from another. This sometimes implies *orthogonality* or *independence* among the topics. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's take a look at the implementation of the models to be compared. The four models, namely `NMF`, `SVD`, `LDA` and `KMEANS` are implemented with a single interface `find_topic` below. Each topic model can be combined with two `vectorization` methods, i.e., term-frequence (TF) and term-frequence-inverse-document-frequence ([TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)). In general, you should choose TFIDF over TF if you have a lot of common words shared by many texts. Those common words are considered as \"noise\" (or stop-words) that may impair the expressness of real important words in topics. However, this difference between TF and TFIDF is not significant for applications on short sentences, because there is less chance for a word to become \"dominant\" out of many short sentences. Finding other possible vector representations of documents is an active research area. For example, vectorizations based on [word embedding](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/) models, e.g. [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) and [doc2vec](http://eng.kifi.com/from-word2vec-to-doc2vec-an-approach-driven-by-chinese-restaurant-process/) have become popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following implementation chooses the keywords of topics as the most frequent words in a ***topic-word distribution***, which is usually generated by the topic models or clustering algorithms. However for some models such as SVD or KMEANS clustering, the topic-word matrix could have both positive and negative values, which makes it difficult to be explained as a \"distribution\" and thus choosing the keywords for topics is more ambiguous. For demostration, I choose to pick the keywords as those with significant absolute values and keep the signs with these keywords - the negative words would be prefixed with a ***\"^\"***, such as ***\"^bergers\"***."

The theory behind their link might be complicated to understand. But in practice, NMF can be mostly seen as a LDA of which the parameters have been fixed to enforce a sparse solution. So it may not be as flexible as LDA if you want to find multiple topics in single documents, e.g., from long articles. But it could work very well out of box for corpora of short texts. This makes NMF attractive for short text analysis because its computation is usually much cheaper than LDA. \n",

    "- Corpora of short texts have some unique characteristics that need to be considered when doing topic finding.\n",
    "- Choice of a method depends on the definition of \"topics\" (high co-occurance, semantic-similarity) and the purpose of topic finding (representation of docs, summarization, outlier detection and etc.)\n",
    "- It's usually a good idea to start with ***KMeans*** or ***NMF***, and to quickly get a better understaning of the structures of texts, including but not limited to,\n",
    "    - sparseness of words in topics\n",
    "    - sparseness of topics in documents\n",
    "    - number of topics\n",
    "    - number of words in each topic\n",
    "    - what does co-occurance imply in your data\n",
    "- ***LDA*** is flexible for different types of tasks. But its parameter tunning should be based on a good understanding of the data. So if you want to try LDA, keep at least another model such as KMeans or NMF as a baseline.\n",
    "- ***SVD*** is mostly useful to capture the variances in the texts. For example, if your data is semi-structured, e.g., forms of a template, screenshots, html tables, SVD might be useful in analyzing them when used together with regular expressions.\n",
